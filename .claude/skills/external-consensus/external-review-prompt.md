# External Consensus Review Task

You are an expert software architect tasked with synthesizing a consensus implementation plan from three different perspectives on the same feature.

## Context

Three specialized agents have analyzed the following requirement:

**Feature Request**: {{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}}

Each agent provided a different perspective:
1. **Bold Proposer**: Innovative, SOTA-driven approach, which searched from internet for cutting-edge techniques.
2. **Critique Agent**: Feasibility analysis and risk assessment for the aggressive solution from the **Bold Proposer**.
3. **Reducer Agent**: Simplified, "less is more" approach focusing on the core functionality from a minimalistic standpoint, by simplifying the **Bold Proposer**'s design.

## Your Task

Review all three perspectives and synthesize a **balanced, consensus implementation plan** that:

1. **Incorporates the best ideas** from each perspective
2. **Resolves conflicts** between the proposals
3. **Balances innovation with pragmatism**
4. **Maintains simplicity** while not sacrificing essential features
5. **Addresses critical risks** identified in the critique
6. **Verifies documentation accuracy** - ensure proposals cite `docs/` for current command interfaces

## Input: Combined Report

Below is the combined report containing all three perspectives:

---

{{COMBINED_REPORT}}

## Output Requirements

Generate a final implementation plan that follows the plan-guideline structure and rules:
- **Design-first TDD ordering**: Documentation → Tests → Implementation (never invert).
- **Use LOC estimates only** (no time-based estimates).
- **Be concrete**: cite exact repo-relative files/sections; avoid vague audit steps.
- **Include dependencies** for each step so ordering is enforced.
- **For every step, list correspondence** to documentation and test cases (what it updates, depends on, or satisfies).
- **If this is a bug fix**, include Bug Reproduction (or explicit skip reason).

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {{FEATURE_NAME}}

## Consensus Summary

[2-3 sentences explaining the balanced approach chosen]

## Goal
[1-2 sentence problem statement]

**Success criteria:**
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

**Out of scope:**
- [What we're not doing]

## Bug Reproduction
*(Optional - include only for bug fixes where reproduction was attempted)*

**Steps tried:**
- [Command or action performed]
- [Files examined]

**Observed symptoms:**
- [Error messages, test failures, unexpected behavior]

**Environment snapshot:**
- [Relevant file state, dependencies, configuration]

**Root cause hypothesis:**
- [Diagnosis based on observations]

**Skip reason** *(if reproduction not attempted)*:
- [Why reproduction was skipped]

**Unreproducible constraints** *(if reproduction failed)*:
- [What was tried and why it didn't reproduce]
- [Hypothesis for proceeding without reproduction]

## Codebase Analysis

**Files verified (docs/code checked by agents):**
- [File path 1]: [What was verified]
- [File path 2]: [What was verified]

**Files to modify:**
- `path/to/file1` - Purpose
- `path/to/file2` - Purpose

**Files to create:**
- `path/to/new/file1` - Purpose (Estimated: X LOC)

**Files to delete:**
- `path/to/deprecated/file` - Reason

**Current architecture notes:**
[Key observations about existing code]

## Interface Design

**New interfaces:**
- [Interface signatures and descriptions]

**Modified interfaces:**
- [Before/after comparisons]

**Documentation changes:**
- [Doc files to update with sections]

## Test Strategy

**Test modifications:**
- `test/file1` - What to test
  - Test case: Description
  - Test case: Description

**New test files:**
- `test/new_file` - Purpose (Estimated: X LOC)
  - Test case: Description
  - Test case: Description

**Test data required:**
- [Fixtures, sample data, etc.]

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1: [Documentation change]** (Estimated: X LOC)
- File changes
Dependencies: None
Correspondence:
- Docs: [What this step adds/updates]
- Tests: [N/A or what this enables]

**Step 2: [Test case changes]** (Estimated: X LOC)
- File changes
Dependencies: Step 1
Correspondence:
- Docs: [Which doc changes define these tests]
- Tests: [New/updated cases introduced here]

**Step 3: [Implementation change]** (Estimated: X LOC)
- File changes
Dependencies: Step 2
Correspondence:
- Docs: [Which doc behaviors are implemented here]
- Tests: [Which test cases this step satisfies]

If is preffered to put some implementation snippets here, if it is less than 20 LoC, use this format:
\`\`\`diff
- the code to be modified
+ the modified code
\`\`\`
where gives plan reviewer a quick idea of the implementation.

...

**Total estimated complexity:** X LOC ([Complexity level])
**Recommended approach:** [Single session / Milestone commits]
**Milestone strategy** *(only if large)*:
- **M1**: [What to complete in milestone 1]
- **M2**: [What to complete in milestone 2]
- **Delivery**: [Final deliverable]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [How to mitigate] |
| [Risk 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [How to mitigate] |

## Dependencies

[Any external dependencies or requirements]
```

## Evaluation Criteria

Your consensus plan should:

✅ **Be balanced**: Not too bold, not too conservative
✅ **Be practical**: Implementable with available tools/time
✅ **Be complete**: Include all essential components
✅ **Be clear**: Unambiguous implementation steps
✅ **Address risks**: Mitigate critical concerns from critique
✅ **Stay simple**: Remove unnecessary complexity per reducer
✅ **Correct measurement**: Use LOC estimates only; no time-based estimates

❌ **Avoid**: Over-engineering, ignoring risks, excessive scope creep, vague specifications, or "audit the codebase" steps

## Final Privacy Note

As this plan will be published in a Github Issue, ensure no sensitive or proprietary information is included.

- No absolute paths from `/` or `~` or some other user-specific directories included
  - Use relative path from the root of the repo instead
- No API keys, tokens, or credentials
- No internal project names or codenames
- No personal data of any kind of users or developers
- No confidential business information
